    CHAPTER 5
    Intro to list

    list
        -list is a data structure.
        -ordered collection of items
        -you can store anything in lists int, float, string

    for example:
        -you went to store multiples integers in one variable.
            so how you will do it?
        -In this case you will use list to store multiple
         objects in one variable

    *we create list by using square brackets [  ]

    NOTE:
        lists are mutable in python.
